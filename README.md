# Enhancing Ensemble Models for Accurate Prediction of Student Performance and Dropout Rates

This research delves into the realm of machine learning algorithms and advanced ensembling techniques. Through my work, I have contributed to the field's understanding of predicting academic achievement and dropout rates with heightened precision.

This study proposes a new model that uses algorithms for machine learning, using the outcomes of their midterm exam scores as the primary data, to estimate university students' final test marks. The predictive capabilities of the supervised classification methods random forests, nearest neighbor, vector support machines, regression models, Naive Bayes, & k-nearest neighbor were calculated and compared in order to forecast the students' final exam marks.
